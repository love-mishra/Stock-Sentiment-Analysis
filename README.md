 
# **Stock Sentiment Analysis**

## **Introduction**

This project explores the application of  sentiment analysis techniques to enhance stock trading strategies. It combines natural language processing (NLP) with financial market data to develop and evaluate a sentiment-adjusted trading approach. Key aspects covered include data collection, sentiment analysis, model development, strategy implementation, performance evaluation, and actionable recommendations.

### **Objective**
The primary objective of this study is to investigate how sentiment analysis of financial news headlines can be leveraged to improve trading decisions. By integrating sentiment insights with historical stock price data, the aim is to develop a robust trading strategy capable of outperforming traditional approaches.

### **Methodology**
- **Data Collection:** Financial news headlines were sourced from Yahoo Finance and the New York Times API for a select group of stocks. Historical stock price data was obtained using the Yahoo Finance API.
  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilized NLP libraries such as NLTK (VADER) and TextBlob to analyze sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, negative) of news headlines.
  
- **Modeling:** Built a Random Forest Classifier to predict sentiment labels based on headline content. Cross-validation and evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC) were used to assess model performance.

- **Trading Strategy:** Developed a sentiment-adjusted moving average strategy (SAMA) combining sentiment scores with technical analysis indicators (e.g., SMA). Simulated trading signals were generated based on sentiment polarity and SMA crossovers.

- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluated trading strategy performance metrics including Final Portfolio Value, Sharpe Ratio, Number of Trades Executed, and Win Ratio. Visualizations were used to illustrate stock price movements, sentiment scores, and portfolio value over time.

## **Data Collection and Preparation**

### **Headlines Collection**
Financial news headlines were collected from Yahoo Finance and the New York Times API for stocks including TSLA, SMCI, AMZN, AVGO, ALB, MSFT, META, NFLX, NVDA. Headlines were filtered based on relevance and recency criteria.

### **Stock Price Data**
Historical stock price data for the same stocks was downloaded using the Yahoo Finance API. Data included Open, High, Low, Close prices, Adjusted Close, and trading Volume.

## **Sentiment Analysis**

### **Approach**
- **NLP Techniques:** Leveraged NLTK for sentiment intensity analysis using VADER lexicon and TextBlob for sentiment polarity scoring.
  
- **Classification:** Classified headlines into positive, neutral, and negative sentiment categories based on sentiment compound scores.

### **Findings**
- Majority of headlines exhibited neutral sentiment, with fewer positive or negative sentiments identified.
- Challenges included accurately capturing nuanced sentiment from financial news.
